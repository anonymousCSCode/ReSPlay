A cross-platform record-and-replay tool for mobile apps

All the evaluation artifacts are available here, which include tools, apps we used, and instructions about how to run the tool on mobile phones. Details can be found in our paper. It is a useful record-and-replay tool, which leverages a most robust visual feature, GUI sequences, to guide replaying more accurately.
